            <h1>About Andy Yang</h1>
                 <p>
                     My name is Andy Yang, I will be a one year student after this spring. I attended UW-Oshkosh for a year in 2014 and FVTC back in 2017 for software development. I found 
                    that I was more interested in creating and designing websites. I've enjoyed being back in school, one of my goals before I turn 30 is to receive an associate 
                    diploma. I am excited to continue my studies and fulfill that goal.

                    <br>
                    I am married to my highschool sweetheart and we have an eleven year old son. As a family we enjoy hiking, traveling, and eating good food. My son 
                    and I enjoy playing video games, fishing, and working out.

                <h2>Favorite Movies</h2>
                <p>
                    I enjoy watching sci-fi movies, it's awesome to see the creativity that directors can provide. Movies such as Arrival, Alien, Planet of the Apes, Interstellar, and many more! I also 
                    enjoy the comedy genre with movies featuring some of my favorite actors such as Adam Sandler, Will Ferrell, Ben Stiller, Jim Carrey, and many others.
